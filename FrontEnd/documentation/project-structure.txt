/components  holds everything in this project.
/screens     holds screens duh.
/styles      should hold commonly used styles.
/(someName)  for reusable components.     


App.js is used for navigation only.
to make new screen usable add this in App.js:
    import NewScreen from "./components/screens/new-screen/NewScreen";

and in commented part add this:
    <Stack.Screen name="ScreenName" component={NewScreen} />
